        <p>I interned for Coachella Magazine during the summer 2018, and 
        through that internship I learned how to use InDesign to create magazine
        spreads. Magazine spreads influence my style of web development a lot,
        allowing me to be more creative. Magazine Spreads also help me plan out
        how I would like my website to look.</p>
